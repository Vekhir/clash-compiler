CHANGED: Blackbox templates no longer have the `outputReg` key, it has been
replaced with the more general `outputUsage` which specifies how signals are
used in terms of whether writes are

    * continuous (i.e. a concurrent context)
    * procedural non-blocking (i.e. `signal` in a VHDL process)
    * procedural blocking (i.e. `variable` in a VHDL process)

The `~OUTPUTWIREREG` tag continues to work for backwards compatibility, but
there is also a new `~OUTPUTUSAGE` tag which is recommended. In the future,
the `~OUTPUTWIREREG` tag may be removed.
