ADDED: `scanlPar` and `scanrPar` in Clash's Prelude, as well as the `RTree` versions `tscanl` and `tscanr`. These variants of `scanl1` and `scanr1` compile to a binary tree of operations, with a depth of `O(log(n))` (`n` being the length of the vector) rather than a depth of `n` for `scanl1` and `scanr1`.
